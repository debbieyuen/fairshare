# App Store Connect — App Review Notes

Paste the relevant sections of this document into the **App Review Information → Notes** field in App Store Connect when submitting Union to TestFlight or the App Store. This is intentionally exhaustive: explicit notes are the cheapest way to head off rejections.

## Demo account

Sign-up in Union normally requires a sponsor's QR code (the app uses an invite-only "web of trust" model). To let App Review test the app end to end **without scanning a QR code**, please use the demo account below:

- **Email:** _[fill in before submission]_
- **Password:** _[fill in before submission]_

This account is already a member of two demo groups so the reviewer can immediately exercise contacts, chat, group currencies, and location features.

> If you'd prefer the reviewer goes through the real sign-up flow instead, paste this one-time invite URL into Safari on the test device, then tap **Open in Union** when prompted:
> `https://app.fairshare.social/?invite=[fill in token]`

## What Union is

Union is a social app for building real-world trust. Members:

1. Meet in person and exchange contact info via QR codes ("the meet flow").
2. Vouch for each other.
3. Form groups and run a small **internal social-credit ledger** ("group credits") to coordinate community activity.
4. Optionally share their live map location with selected contacts.

There is **no** real-money transfer, no purchasable digital good, and no cryptocurrency.

## Group "credits" / "currencies" — Guideline 3.1

Each group can define its own internal token (often called credits, coins, or points). These tokens:

- Are **fictional, in-app social tokens with no real-world or cash value**.
- **Cannot be purchased, redeemed, exchanged, withdrawn, or transferred outside the app.**
- Are **not** money, securities, cryptocurrency, or any regulated financial instrument.
- Exist only in our database, scoped to a single group.
- Are minted as a small "Daily Income" by each group on a schedule the group decides — purely a community game-mechanic.

There is **no** in-app purchase, no Stripe / PayPal / Apple Pay integration, no fiat on-ramp, no fiat off-ramp, no NFT/blockchain integration. Union does not require IAP because we never sell anything inside the app.

(Schema labels like `payment_received` are internal event names; the user-facing UI exclusively uses words like "credits" and "send" — no real-money payment language.)

---

## User-generated content & safety — Guideline 1.2

Union has user-generated content (chat messages, profile photos, contact selfies, group logos, display names visible to other members). The app provides:

1. **Report objectionable content.** Every chat message from another user has a `⋮` button that opens a Report dialog. The contact details screen has an explicit "Report" button. Reports go into a `reports` table; we review them within 24 hours.
2. **Block users.** The contact details screen has a "Block" button. Blocking removes the user from the reporter's contacts, chat, nearby alerts, and map. A "Manage blocked users" screen in Profile lets users unblock later.
3. **Zero-tolerance policy.** The Terms of Use (linked in-app from Profile and at https://app.fairshare.social/terms.html) explicitly forbid objectionable content and abusive behavior, and state that violators are removed.
4. **Server-side enforcement.** Reports and blocks are enforced via Postgres RPCs (`report_content`, `block_user`, `unblock_user`) with row-level security — clients can only block / report as themselves.

---

## Account deletion — Guideline 5.1.1(v)

Users can delete their account from inside the app:

**Profile → Delete Account** → typed-confirmation dialog → calls the `delete_my_account()` RPC, which permanently deletes the auth user, profile, contacts, memberships, transactions, messages, photos, and location data.

Deletion is irreversible.

## Permissions & background modes

| Permission / mode | Why Union needs it | Where it's used in the app |
|---|---|---|
| Camera (`NSCameraUsageDescription`) | Scanning sponsor QR codes at sign-up; exchanging contacts on the "meet" screen; taking selfies with new contacts | Auth screen → Sign Up → Scan QR; bottom-bar 🤝 Meet button; contact handshake selfie |
| Photo Library (`NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`) | Picking a profile photo, group logo, or suggested-picture from the user's library | Profile screen → tap avatar; Group screen → tap group logo; Suggest-picture flow on contact details |
| Location When-In-Use (`NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`) | Showing nearby Union members the user has explicitly chosen to be alerted about; reverse-geocoding for selfies on the Globe screen | Bottom-bar Globe; Contact details → "Notify if nearby" toggle |
| Location Always (`NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`) | Continuing live location share to a specific contact while the app is backgrounded — only after the user explicitly toggles "Share My Location" with a duration | Contact details → "Share My Location" toggle (For an Hour / Day / Week / Indefinitely) |
| `UIBackgroundModes` → `location` | Same as above — required so the location share keeps streaming when the user puts the phone away | iOS only flips `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true` when the user holds Always authorization AND has at least one active outbound share (see `BackgroundLocationPlugin.swift`) |
| `UIBackgroundModes` → `remote-notification` | APNs push for new chat messages, contact requests, and nearby alerts | Capacitor Push Notifications plugin |

### Background location demonstration

To exercise the background-location code path:

1. Sign in on the demo device.
2. Open any contact → toggle **"Share My Location"** → choose any duration.
3. Grant **Allow Always** (the system will prompt; you can also raise it later in Settings → Privacy → Location → Union → Always).
4. Lock the device and walk a short distance, or use Xcode's **Simulate Location** to move a few hundred meters.
5. Re-open the app on the second test device (or the web at https://app.fairshare.social) signed in as the contact you shared with — the moving pin updates in near-real-time.

When the user toggles **Share My Location** off, or the chosen duration expires, the app immediately stops calling `startUpdatingLocation` and sets `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = false`.

## Sign in with Apple — Guideline 4.8

Union uses **email + password authentication only** (via Supabase Auth). It does **not** offer Google / Facebook / Apple SSO. Per Guideline 4.8, Sign in with Apple is required only when third-party SSO providers are offered, so it is not required here. We may add it in a future release.

## Privacy practices

- We do **not** use any third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.
- We do **not** share data with advertisers, data brokers, or trackers.
- We do **not** track users across other apps or websites.
- All transit is HTTPS / TLS via standard `URLSession` and the WebView; we do not implement custom cryptography (`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false`).

The app's privacy policy is linked from inside the app (Profile → Privacy Policy) and at https://app.fairshare.social/privacy.html.

A Privacy Manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) is included in the bundle. It declares:

- `NSPrivacyTracking = false`
- Data categories collected: email, photos, location, user content (messages), display name, push token
- Required-Reason API: `UserDefaults` (CA92.1 — used by the background-location plugin to persist Supabase config across app launches so location keeps uploading after a relaunch).

## Age rating

We have answered the App Store Connect age rating questionnaire conservatively. Under Apple's current age-rating system (4+, 9+, 13+, 16+, 18+ — the old 17+ band no longer exists), Union is rated **18+** via **Override to Higher Age Rating** because:

- Chat is unmoderated user-generated text.
- Users can meet new people via QR-code handshakes.
- Users can share live location with contacts.
- Our sign-up flow and Terms of Use require users to confirm they are **18 or older**. (Apple requires an override when a EULA's minimum age exceeds the calculated rating.)

After completing the content/capability questions (including the messaging / user-generated content capability), we select **Override to Higher Age Rating → 18+** rather than "Not Applicable". The sign-up gate, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy all consistently state an 18+ minimum age.

## Reviewer FAQ

- **Q: Can I sign up without a sponsor?** Use the demo account above, or paste the one-time invite link into Safari on the device.
- **Q: How do I trigger a chat message?** Open one of the demo groups → **Chat** tab → type a message. To test the report flow, use the second demo account on a separate device (or web) to send a message, then tap the `⋮` next to it.
- **Q: How do I test "Block"?** Open a contact → scroll to the **Safety** card → tap **Block**. Confirm. The contact disappears from the contacts list, chat, and map.
- **Q: How do I delete my account?** Profile → **Delete Account** → type `DELETE` → tap **Delete my account**.
